# README for Maps in My Nav2 SLAM Package

This directory contains documentation related to the maps used in the My Nav2 SLAM Package. 

## Overview

The maps are essential for the navigation and SLAM functionalities of the robot. They provide the necessary information for the robot to understand its environment and navigate effectively.

## Creating Maps

To create a new map, you can use the following steps:

1. **Collect Data**: Use a robot equipped with a laser scanner or depth camera to collect data of the environment.
2. **Use SLAM Tools**: Utilize SLAM tools such as `gmapping`, `cartographer`, or any other preferred SLAM algorithm to generate a map from the collected data.
3. **Save the Map**: Once the map is generated, save it in the appropriate format (e.g., `.yaml` and `.pgm` files).

## Using Existing Maps

To use existing maps in your project:

1. Place the map files (e.g., `.yaml` and `.pgm`) in this directory or a designated maps directory.
2. Update the configuration files to point to the new map files.
3. Launch the navigation stack with the appropriate launch file.

## Additional Resources
